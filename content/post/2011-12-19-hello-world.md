Obligatory first post:

```
   Hello, world.
```

I've chosen to follow the GitHub masses and publish this blog with
Brandon Mathis' most excellent [Octopress](http://octopress.org/).
Next on the agenda is to port a number of my wiki notes and how-to's
to a more ... revision controlled outlet:
[GitHub](https://github.com).

Stay tuned - Eric
