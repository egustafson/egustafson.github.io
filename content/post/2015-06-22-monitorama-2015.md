This year's [Monitorama][] was another success for [@obfuscurity][] and the
 monitoring community.  My one line observation of this years event is that the
 event was "less pragmatic" than last year.  I would rate the more abstract
 qualities of quality, diversity, and my overall desire to attend the same as
 last year -- high.  My personal preference for this, and most, conferences is
 pragmatism and so I call this out; my ranking of presentations certainly
 reflects this, more so than any general vote of quality.

Without further ado, my ranked recommendations for Monitorama 2015 review:

Must Watch
==========

Working with Riemann
--------------------

|        |                 |
|--------|-----------------|
|Speaker | Kyle Kingsbury \<https://github.com/aphyr\> -- creator of Riemann |
|Video   | https://vimeo.com/131385889 |

Kyle provides a good overview of Riemann, his "part time project".  While not an
in depth discussion of Riemann, Kyle does a good job of covering the core
concepts and breadth of what Riemann can accomplish.  An excellent source if one
is trying to discover if and where Riemann can be utilized.

The Dark Art of Container Monitoring
------------------------------------

|        |                 |
|--------|-----------------|
|Speaker| Loris Degioanni \<https://github.com/ldegio\>
|Company| sysdig \<http://www.sysdig.org/\> 
|GitHub |  \<https://github.com/draios\>
|Video|   https://vimeo.com/131495389
|Slides|  http://www.slideshare.net/LorisDegioanni/monitorama-slides

Loris demonstrated container monitoring with his relatively new tool [sysdig][]
and [cAdvisor][] from Google.  This is an excellent overview and demo of both
tools.  Additionally, Loris demos a commercial product that takes [sysdig][] to
the next level, providing a web based dashboard of an entire running cluster --
[sysdig cloud][].

Heka (workshop)
---------------

|        |                 |
|--------|-----------------|
|Speaker |     Rob Miller \<https://github.com/rafrombrc\>|
|Representing| Mozilla Heka \<https://hekad.readthedocs.org/en/v0.9.2/\>
|GitHub  |     https://github.com/mozilla-services/heka|
|Video|        https://vimeo.com/131581322|
|Slides|       http://www.slideshare.net/devopsdays/heka-rob-miller (alternate deck)|

Rob presents an architectural overview of the Heka stream processing engine.  He
discusses some of its many use-cases.  This presentation will convey to the
viewer enough to determine if Heka is appropriate for potential tasks.

Insightful
==========

If you make it past the first three "Must Watch" presentations then the
following are where I would recommend spending your time next.  The first two
are less pragmatic, but cover lessons learned and potentially positive ways of
looking at monitoring issues as learned from Netflix.  The Last is an good
overview and introduction to Druid.

Intriguing
==========

To continue exploring the Monitorama 2015, the presentations below were my pick
of other 'above the median' (not everyone can be above 50%, only half of us),
presentations; if you like my choices so far, hopefully these will also be
intriguing to you.

Honorable Mention
=================

There was one presentation that was less general, but for the audience where
it's appropriate, it is certainly worth a watch .. not to mention any names like
"Todd".

Cyanite (workshop)
------------------

|        |                 |
|--------|-----------------|
|Speaker |Pierre-Yves Ritschard
|Video|   https://vimeo.com/131581325

Cyanite is a merger of Graphite and Cassandra.  For large metric storage it
appears to be a project certainly worth investigating.


The Origins of Monitorama
-------------------------

Finally, in digging through twitter postings, I discovered that [@obfuscurity] has
made a guest contribution to the Librato blog and covers:
