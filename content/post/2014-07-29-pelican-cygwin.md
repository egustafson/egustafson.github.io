One of the many good reasons I chose
[Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) as a static blog site generator
was because I felt confident I could deploy and use the tools under
Windows, with [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/).  What I couldn't find
was any reference to success installing Pelican under Cygwin.  It
turns out that the combination is not difficult to make work.  Here is
my success story installing Pelican under Cygwin.

# Prerequisites

+ Windows -- hopefully obvious.
+ [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) -- also hopefully obvious
+ [Cygwin Ports](http://cygwinports.org/) [^1]
+ and the following Cygwin Packages:
  - git
  - python
  - python-setuptools

[^1]: I consistently add [Cygwin Ports](http://cygwinports.org/) to my
      Cygwin installation.  Its possible these instructions work with
      out adding the ports collection in.

# Procedure

Installing [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) under
[Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) ended up being fairly straight
forward.  I encountered one small problem: some of Pelican's
dependencies would not install from source.  This is easily
circumvented by using the equivalent Cygwin_ packages.  With out
further ado.

## 1. Install Pelican Dependencies from Cygwin

Pelican Dependencies: http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.4.0/install.html#dependencies

Start Cygwin's `setup-x86.exe` [^2] to update your installation.
Install the following packages, if not already present.

[^2]: https://www.cygwin.com/install.html

- pypy-jinja2
- pypy-pygments
- python-docutils
- python-pytz
- python-six
- pypy-markupsafe
- pypy-dateutil

## 2. Complete using the command line

Start a cygwin terminal window and use command line tools to complete
the installation.  If you do not already have `pip`
<http://pip.readthedocs.org/> installed, use `easy_install`, from
`python-setuptools` to install `pip`.

```bash
> easy_install pip
...
> pip install "git+https://github.com/getpelican/pelican.git#egg-pelican"
...
# ... a lot of output as the recursive dependencies are resolved ...
# expect warnings, but a final notice saying pelican was successfully
# installed along with additional, dependent packages.
...
> pelican --help
...
# output consistent with the help from pelican.
```

Note:  Pelican can be simply installed with `pip` using `pip
install pelican`.  I chose to pull Pelican from source so I could
stay on their trunk.


# Verify

It doesn't count if it doesn't work.  The following steps are the smoke
test I ran to convince myself the installation was working reasonably
correct.

```bash
> mkdir tmp; cd tmp   # (optional, do what makes sense)
> pelican-quickstart
...
# give reasonable answers
...
> pelican content
...
> ./develop_server start
...
```

Now, point your favorite web browser at http://localhost:8000/ and the
template site should be visible.

Note: my first instinct was to simply point a browser directly at
the files generated by Pelican in the `output` directory; this was
only partially successful.  I observed the rendered HTML, but no
styling; it threw me off for a minute,

So far I have not encountered any problems.  Using Windows & Cygwin is
always a small adventure for \*nix native projects, so I'm
... cautiously optimistic.
