This year's [OSCON](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014) was my first attendance of
the conference; I was pleasantly surprised.  The conference is 5 days, the first
two of which are half day tutorial sessions, and the remaining 3 being the core
conference.  I attended the 3 core days of the conference, and my brain was
completely overflowed by the end.

In this post, part 1 of 2, the interesting items of note in the Keynote
presentations are discussed.  A follow on post will catalog the main sessions I
attended.

# Keynotes

Each morning OSCON has an hour's worth of 5-15 keynote presentations -- a format
I hadn't seen, but like.  High density and thought provoking, each keynote is
recorded and available for every one to view.  The following are my picks for
most intriguing, (in no particular order).


- [Building an API for the Planet with a new Approach to Satellites]
  (http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014/public/schedule/detail/36202)

    The folks at `Planet Labs <https://www.planet.com/>`_ are building bird
    sized, (raptor sized) satellites and deploying them in a polar orbit to
    create the worlds first "planet scanner".  A goal being to image the entire
    planet, every day, as the earth rotates beneath the ring of satellites.
    And, ... there's more - this was OSCON: make the image data available to the
    public.

- [Anticipating the Future - an Introduction to Value Chain Mapping]
  (http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014/public/schedule/detail/35743)

    Simon successfully argues that the "lemming" strategy of how to be
    successful in business endeavors is not necessarily the most effective.  In
    lieu of following the leader, he argues and then exemplifies a analytic,
    (and scientific), approach to determining what actions would likely be more
    successful for a business -- through the life cycle of a business.

- [The Concert Programmer]
  (http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014/public/schedule/detail/36818)

    Entertaining, and certainly intriguing, Andrew Sorensen does actually
    perform a live concert by programming the music live.  In this 10 minute
    performance Andrew explains the coding he performs while code-performing his
    musical piece.

- [Yes, Your Refrigerator Is Trying To Kill You: Bad Actors and the Internet of
  Things](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014/public/schedule/detail/36257)

    Yes, security updates to intelligent appliances do matter; no, they are not
    happening.  Beth Flanagan does an excellent job of relaying the increasing
    hazards lacking security in the Internet of Things could present to all
    humans on the planet.
