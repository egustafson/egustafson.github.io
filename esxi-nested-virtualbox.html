                <p>This process describes how to configure an ESXi Linux guest so that the guest
can then run VirtualBox and create a nested, 64 bit guest within the ESXi guest
&#8212; Nested&nbsp;Virtualization.</p>
<p>There is nothing special about the use of Linux as either the ESXi guest, or the
nested guest.  Any supported operating system <em>should</em> work at either nesting
level.  This includes nesting ESXi inside of ESXi, which appears to be the most
common form of documentation to describe this&nbsp;process.</p>
<p>This process details <em>manually</em> editing an ESXi hosts&#8217;s <span class="caps">VM</span> configuration file to
direct the inclusion of support for virtualization from within the guest.  ESXi
version 5.5 is specifically addressed.  I found a number of blog postings
detailing earlier versions of ESXi, unfortunately the process changed in 5.5 and
the newer version is much less prevalently documented.  I also found blog
postings detailing how to use the vSphere Web <span class="caps">UI</span> to effect the reconfiguration.
Unfortunately, the Web <span class="caps">UI</span> is not part of the free license VMWare grants for an
ESXi host.  As a consequence, this posting details the manual editing to enable
nested virtualization &#8212; needed if all one has is the free bits from&nbsp;VMWare.</p>

<div class="section" id="enable-ssh-access-to-the-esxi-server">
<h3>0. - Enable <span class="caps">SSH</span> access to the ESXi&nbsp;Server</h3>
<p>If you have not already done so, this process will require direct access to the
ESXi instance&#8217;s configuration.  VMWare often calls this &quot;Tech Support Mode&quot;.
This can be done from the ESXi host&#8217;s console, or through the vSphere Client.
See the appendix in this document titled, <a class="reference internal" href="#enabling-ssh-access-to-esxi-5-5">Enabling <span class="caps">SSH</span> access to ESXi 5.5</a>,
for more detailed instructions on how to enable <span class="caps">SSH</span>&nbsp;access.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="create-an-esxi-vm">
<h3>1. - Create an ESXi <span class="caps">VM</span></h3>
<p>Create an ESXi <span class="caps">VM</span> for the initial, outer guest.  VMWare &#8216;virtual machine
version&#8217; 8 or greater should be used; this is the default for ESXi 5.5.  Install
the operating system, (Linux), nothing special here, just perform a normal
install; ensure the installed <span class="caps">OS</span> is 64 bit.  Do make sure to provision the disk
with enough space for the nested <span class="caps">OS</span>&#8217;s virtual disk.  An appropriate amount of
<span class="caps">CPU</span> and memory will also be needed.  The first time you attempt this I recommend
over provisioning all three: disk, memory, and <span class="caps">CPU</span>.  As I was experimenting I
found that the nested <span class="caps">OS</span> ran notably slower; giving everything extra resources
seemed to improve performance.  I am still experimenting with fine tuning
resource overheads.  Generally I&#8217;m finding that virtualized components do behave
as advertised, but default configurations on install do need some finer tuning
&#8212; in short, no&nbsp;surprises.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="shutdown-the-esxi-vm">
<h3>2. - Shutdown the ESXi <span class="caps">VM</span></h3>
<p>With an ESXi <span class="caps">VM</span> configured and installed with an operating system, you are ready
to (re)configure the <span class="caps">VM</span> to allow nested virtualization.  The reconfiguration
will happen to the <span class="caps">VM</span>&#8217;s definition, and as a consequence, the <span class="caps">VM</span> needs to be in
the stopped state.  ESXi, as all others I&#8217;m aware of, does not let you
(virtually) modify the hardware while the <span class="caps">VM</span> is running.  Stop the ESXi <span class="caps">VM</span> that
will be reconfigured to support nested&nbsp;virtualization.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="edit-the-vm-s-configuration">
<h3><strong>3. - Edit the <span class="caps">VM</span>&#8217;s&nbsp;Configuration</strong></h3>
<p>This step is the critical step.  The ESXi <span class="caps">VM</span> must be shutdown, as noted
previously; if it is not the change will be reverted by ESXi.  Fundamentally,
the change is simple:  add the configuration setting <tt class="docutils literal">vhv.enable = &quot;<span class="caps">TRUE</span>&quot;</tt> to
the configuration.  This must be added to the <span class="caps">VM</span>&#8217;s <tt class="docutils literal">.vmx</tt> file.</p>
<p><span class="caps">SSH</span> into the ESXi server and then locate and edit the <span class="caps">VM</span>&#8217;s .vmx&nbsp;file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>&gt; find / -name <span class="se">\*</span>.vmx
&gt; <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">&#39;vhv.enable = &quot;TRUE&quot;&#39;</span> &gt;&gt; /path/to/host.vmx
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="done">
<h3>4. -&nbsp;Done</h3>
<p>Once the change to the <span class="caps">VM</span>&#8217;s configuration is effected, simply boot the <span class="caps">VM</span> and
use VirtualBox within the ESXi <span class="caps">VM</span> to create a nested <span class="caps">VM</span>.</p>
<p>Note:  You should be able to create 64 bit, and multiple processor/core <span class="caps">VM</span>&#8217;s, up
to the limits of the ESXi <span class="caps">VM</span>&#8217;s resources.  If the (re)configuration was not
successful then it is likely that VirtualBox will allow you to create a <span class="caps">VM</span>, but
that <span class="caps">VM</span> will be restricted to 32 bit and will not support multiple processors -
this is a specific pattern I noted prior to discovering the correct process for
ESXi 5.5.  Earlier versions of ESXi have a different process, not described
here, and without my crystal ball, I&#8217;m at a loss for future&nbsp;versions.</p>

<div class="section" id="extra-credit">
<h2>Extra&nbsp;Credit</h2>
<p>In discovering the above process, which I distilled to what I felt was the
minimum, for simplicity, I made a few &quot;superfluous&quot; discoveries.  So that the
above process may be more broadly applicable, an so that the reader is
more informed, I have detailed the &quot;extras&quot;&nbsp;here.</p>
<div class="section" id="old-wives-tales">
<h3>Old Wives&nbsp;Tales</h3>
<p>Technically not old wives tales, the following details are floating around in
blog postings and are no longer accurate, for ESXi 5.5.  At one point in time,
they were correct; I performed the process detailed here with out them as
verification that they were not&nbsp;necessary.</p>
<div class="section" id="vhv-allow-vs-vhv-enable">
<h4><tt class="docutils literal">vhv.allow</tt> vs. <tt class="docutils literal">vhv.enable</tt></h4>
<p>Earlier versions of ESXi, possibly as late as early 5.x versions, used a
slightly different means of enabling nested virtualization.  The <tt class="docutils literal">vhv.allow</tt>
parameter was applied to the ESXi server&#8217;s configuration in
<tt class="docutils literal">/etc/vmware/config</tt>.  This is not necessary, but does not conflict with the
per <span class="caps">VM</span> configuration detailed in this posting and required by ESXi&nbsp;5.5.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="editing-the-vm-s-cpu-preferences">
<h4>Editing the <span class="caps">VM</span>&#8217;s <span class="caps">CPU</span>&nbsp;Preferences</h4>
<p>In other postings on this subject I noted that an additional step involving
editing the <span class="caps">VM</span>&#8217;s <span class="caps">CPU</span> Preferences was detailed.  Changing the &quot;<span class="caps">CPU</span>/<span class="caps">MMU</span> Virtualization&quot; from
&#8216;Automatic&#8217; to forced settings for Intel <span class="caps">VT</span>-x and hardware <span class="caps">MMU</span> virtualization
appears to no longer be required.  I have successfully nested VirtualBox 64 bit
VMs inside ESXi 5.5 VMs with the &#8216;Automatic&#8217; setting.  Caveat:  I have found no official
documentation discussing this for 5.5 either&nbsp;way.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="esxi-networking-promiscuous-mode">
<h3>ESXi Networking - Promiscuous&nbsp;Mode</h3>
<p>Almost all of the writings I encountered that discuss nesting virtualization
with ESXi cite setting &quot;networking&quot; into promiscuous mode.  This is not a
requirement for nesting virtualization.  The basic example of nesting
VirtualBox, (using <span class="caps">NAT</span>), inside an ESXi Linux instance was executed with out
adjusting any ESXi network&nbsp;parameters.</p>
<p>Enabling promiscuous mode <em>is</em> required if your ESXi <span class="caps">VM</span> will nest virtual
machines that require bridge mode, sometimes evidenced by the fact that the
nested <span class="caps">VM</span> has a new ethernet <span class="caps">MAC</span> address.  Promiscuous mode, be it on ESXi, or
other technologies, is the means by which a network interface can receive
packets for hardware addresses, (<span class="caps">MAC</span> addresses), other than the one the
interface is&nbsp;assigned.</p>
<p>The most common nesting example I observed was ESXi inside ESXi.  In this case,
promiscuous mode would be necessary with the default ESXi networking
configuration because that model is a bridged model in which each <span class="caps">VM</span> is given a
newly allocated, and different, <span class="caps">MAC</span>&nbsp;address.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="disk-performance">
<h3>Disk&nbsp;Performance</h3>
<p>During my initial experimentation with nested <span class="caps">VM</span>&#8217;s I observed a clear decrease
in performance of the nested <span class="caps">VM</span>.  My initial experimentation mostly only went as
far as installing the <span class="caps">OS</span> on the nested <span class="caps">VM</span>.  Installing an <span class="caps">OS</span> is generally a disk
intensive&nbsp;activity.</p>
<p>Disk virtualization is more expensive than most.  Nesting virtualized disks will
accumulate &quot;virtualization debt&quot; quicker than other virtualized components.  The
short, but rambling explanation goes something like&nbsp;this:</p>
<blockquote>
In my inner <span class="caps">VM</span> I write a block to &quot;disk&quot;.  This traverses the inner <span class="caps">OS</span>&#8217;s
file system code and is mapped to a sector on the inner <span class="caps">VM</span>&#8217;s <em>virtual</em> block
device.  Writing is the passed to the outer <span class="caps">VM</span>, traverses the file system
code, and is mapped to the outer <span class="caps">VM</span>&#8217;s <em>virtual</em> block device.  Finally, the
block is passed to the host, (physical), file system, mapped through to a
sector, and finally placed on the actual physical device.  &#8212; If your head is
spinning now, it should be.  That&#8217;s <strong>three</strong> times the block is passed
through file system code on it&#8217;s eventual path to a physical write.</blockquote>
<p>This problem is understood in the virtualization community, and there are
methods for avoiding differing degrees of the penalty based on the requirements
of an installation.  I will not cover these here.  My point:  if your nested
<span class="caps">VM</span>&#8217;s strike you as slow, this may be a significant part of the&nbsp;why.</p>
<p>Armed with the above understanding, I set out to make things run a bit smoother,
i.e. faster.  Here are a few ideas I had; some I carried out successfully, some
are on my &quot;to try&quot;&nbsp;list:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Enabling &quot;Host I/O Caching&quot;.  This seemed to help and was quick to&nbsp;try.</li>
<li>Giving each virtualized device some &#8216;room to breath&#8217; eases the pressure.
Some extra <span class="caps">CPU</span> and memory felt like it&nbsp;helped.</li>
<li>Using alternative &quot;devices&quot; for disk should help as well, I haven&#8217;t tried
this yet.<ul>
<li>Raw disk device, by passing the virtualization of the device&nbsp;completely.</li>
<li>iSCSI</li>

<div class="section" id="enabling-ssh-access-to-esxi-5-5">
<h3>Enabling <span class="caps">SSH</span> access to ESXi&nbsp;5.5</h3>
<p>ESXi supports direct <span class="caps">SSH</span> access to the server running ESXi.  This mechanism is
referred to in VMWare documentation as &quot;Tech Support Mode&quot;.  VMWare has a
<a class="reference external" href="http://kb.vmware.com/">Knowledge Base</a> article elaborating the process for a range of versions: <a class="reference external" href="http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1017910"><span class="caps">KB</span>
article&nbsp;1017910</a></p>
<p>Here is the verbal description to enable <span class="caps">SSH</span> to the ESXi server from the Windows
vSphere (thick)&nbsp;Client:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Select the server&#8217;s Configuration tab.  Select the server, not a child <span class="caps">VM</span>,
from the left hand side and then select the &#8216;Configuration&#8217; tab across the&nbsp;top.</li>
<li>Select the &#8216;Security Profile&#8217; from the Software section on the left hand side
of the Configuration&nbsp;tab.</li>
<li>Open the &#8216;Services Properties&#8217; dialog window.  Click on the &#8216;Properties&#8230;&#8217;
link along the right hand side near the top in the &#8216;Services&#8217; section of the
Security Profile&nbsp;table.</li>
<li>Open the &#8216;<span class="caps">SSH</span> Options&#8217; dialog.  In the &#8216;Services Properties&#8217; dialog scroll
down to the &#8216;<span class="caps">SSH</span>&#8217; label and select it, (one click).  Then press the
&#8216;Options&#8230;&#8217; button in the lower right corner of the&nbsp;dialog.</li>
<li>Use the &#8216;<span class="caps">SSH</span> Options&#8217; dialog to enable <span class="caps">SSH</span> by choosing &quot;Start and stop with
host&quot;.  The <span class="caps">SSH</span> service can also be started immediately with the &#8216;Start&#8217;&nbsp;button.</li>
<li>Access the host by ssh&#8217;ing to the <span class="caps">IP</span> or hostname of the ESXi server and
logging in with an appropriate account.  The &#8216;root&#8217; user and password created
during ESXi initial installation will&nbsp;work.</li>
