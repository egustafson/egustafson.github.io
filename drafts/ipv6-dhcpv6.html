                <p>In my previous article, <a class="reference external" href="https://egustafson.github.io/ipv6-tunneling.html">IPv6 Tunneling over IPv6 Networks</a>, I discussed how to
connect a <span class="caps">LAN</span> to the IPv6 public Internet.  This article continues the theme,
discussing the issues surrounding the configuration of the <span class="caps">LAN</span> for&nbsp;IPv6.</p>
<p>Looking at how IPv4 <span class="caps">LAN</span>&#8217;s are configured proves to be instructive.  Many of the
techniques, and all of the patterns turn out to have parallels in IPv6.  During
the design of IPv6 there was opportunity for some refactoring from lessons
learned in IPv4.  Initial host configuration was an area that received some
attention, and so, we will explore the new methods provided by IPv6 as well as
the traditional techniques carried forward from&nbsp;IPv4.</p>
<div class="section" id="network-autoconfiguration">
<h2>Network&nbsp;Autoconfiguration</h2>
<p>The goal here is to identify how hosts joining an IPv6 network can come to
discover and then interoperate on that network.  The network <em>may</em> also have
IPv4, but it should not be required.  Specifically, the goal is to show how
hosts can, as automatically as possible, configure themselves on an <strong>IPv6
only</strong> network.  The same (pre)configuration should also work if the network
happens to support IPv4, and the hosts should then configure and join the IPv4
network as&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>There are two use cases that are used to vet the proposed methods.  The first is
the &quot;small lab&quot; use case.  Think of a small, less than 100 hosts, lab
environment, or <span class="caps">SOHO</span> office.  In this sort of environment some of the hosts are
very dynamic, and some are more static with specific functions assigned to them;
for instance, a mail, or <span class="caps">IRC</span> server.  The second use case is the prototype
environment for a distributed application.  Often such environments are created
with <span class="caps">VM</span>&#8217;s using tools such as <a class="reference external" href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> inside a developer&#8217;s laptop.  The
&quot;environment&quot; can be paused and restarted, it can be relocated, and the hosts
are often destroyed and recreated for a &quot;fresh install&quot;.  In both cases, formal
rigor in configuring and maintaining the network are not as important as a
degree of automation combined with flexibility to manually adjust things when&nbsp;necessary.</p>
<p>In an IPv4 world, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol"><span class="caps">DHCP</span></a> combined with <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System"><span class="caps">DNS</span></a> are the go-to tools for such
configuration.  As luck has it, both are available in the IPv6 world as
well. <span class="caps">DNS</span> remains unchanged, except for the addition of the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_address#IPv6_addresses_in_the_Domain_Name_System"><span class="caps">AAAA</span></a> record that
holds IPv6 addresses; <span class="caps">AAAA</span> records are retrievable via IPv4 as well.  <span class="caps">DHCP</span>
functions the same, but the specifics are adapted for IPv6 and to disambiguate,
is known as <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHCPv6">DHCPv6</a>; there is a separate <span class="caps">RFC</span>, <a class="reference external" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3315"><span class="caps">RFC</span>-3315</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="ipv6-autoconfiguration">
<h3>IPv6&nbsp;Autoconfiguration</h3>
<p>During the design of IPv6, codenamed &#8216;IPng&#8217; at the time, the design of
&quot;autoconfiguration&quot; for <span class="caps">IP</span> was refactored to support a more automated method by
which hosts could join an IPv6 network.  In the base IPv4 protocol there is no
explicit support for autoconfiguration.  In IPv6 autoconfiguration support was
initially integrated into <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICMPv6">ICMPv6</a>.  This comes in the form of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbor_Discovery_Protocol">Neighbor Discovery
Protocol</a> (<span class="caps">NDP</span>) and includes the ability for a host to automatically&nbsp;discover:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Neighbor Discovery and Advertisement, replacing IPv4&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol"><span class="caps">ARP</span></a>.</li>
<li>Network address prefix&nbsp;discovery.</li>
<li>Link (L2) parameter discovery, such as <span class="caps">MTU</span>.</li>
<li>Next-hop determination through Router Solicitation and Advertisement (<span class="caps">RA</span>) -&nbsp;Routing.</li>
<li>Duplicate address detection, allowing hosts to generate a host address and
determine if it is a duplicate.  (If so, they will pick&nbsp;another).</li>
</ul>
<p>The above tools that made up the original <span class="caps">NDP</span> allow a host to perform what is
formally called <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#Stateless_address_autoconfiguration_.28SLAAC.29">Stateless address autoconfiguration</a> (<span class="caps">SLAAC</span>).  Additionally,
<span class="caps">NDP</span>, through Router Solicitation and Router Advertisement (<span class="caps">RA</span>), allows a host
to define itself a unique host address, determine its network address, and
router(s).  This is all the necessary  details a host needs to start sending and
receiving <span class="caps">IP</span> packets.  The IPng designers believed they had successfully
refactored the base <span class="caps">IP</span>, including <span class="caps">ICMP</span>, protocol to handle&nbsp;autoconfiguration.</p>
<p>The refactoring was not agile enough.  While hosts can configure the <span class="caps">IP</span> layer
with <span class="caps">SLAAC</span>, it turns out that DHCPv4 is used provide added functionality beyond
simply configuring the <span class="caps">IP</span> layer of a host.  The almost universally used feature
of <span class="caps">DHCP</span> beyond <span class="caps">IP</span> layer is communicating the <span class="caps">DNS</span> server&#8217;s <span class="caps">IP</span> address.  <span class="caps">SLAAC</span> did
not initially have support for this and thus DHCPv6 was born.  The ICMPv6 Router
Advertisement was extended in <a class="reference external" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6106"><span class="caps">RFC</span>-6106</a> to allow the inclusion of <span class="caps">DNS</span>
configuration information in the <span class="caps">RA</span>&nbsp;message.</p>
<p><span class="caps">RFC</span>-6106, which allows <span class="caps">DNS</span> details in router advertisements, is not the end of
the story.  Firstly, its adoption has not been slow, and secondly, there remain
additional configuration details not covered by the <span class="caps">RFC</span> that are desired when
autoconfiguring hosts on an <span class="caps">IP</span> network.  In fact, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority"><span class="caps">IANA</span></a> cites well over 150
option parameters registered for <span class="caps">DHCP</span> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="stateful-and-stateless-dhcpv6">
<h3>Stateful and Stateless&nbsp;DHCPv6</h3>
<p>The ability for a host to autoconfigure, through <span class="caps">SLAAC</span>, it&#8217;s IPv6 details gives
rise to a new mode of use for <span class="caps">DHCP</span> - &quot;Stateless DHCPv6&quot;.  In this mode, the host
first uses <span class="caps">SLAAC</span> to configure its IPv6 details and then uses DHCPv6 to request
additional details like <span class="caps">DNS</span>, <span class="caps">NTP</span>, etc.  In this mode the host indicates it is
operating &quot;stateless&quot; and the server does not perform address&nbsp;assignment.</p>
<p>In addition to the stateless mode, DHCPv6 can also be used in a &quot;stateful&quot; mode
where an IPv6 address is assigned from the server&#8217;s pool of addresses.  IPv6
allows and most often requires hosts to have multiple IPv6 addresses assigned to
a single interface; the link-local address is an excellent example of this.
Because hosts must support multiple addresses per interface it is possible to
use both <span class="caps">SLAAC</span> and stateful DHCPv6 to configure a host.  If both methods are
used then there will be multiple IPv6 addresses assigned to the interface.  The
link-local address is also required, so using both methods will ensure the
interface has at least three&nbsp;addresses.</p>
<p>The late arrival of <span class="caps">DNS</span> configuration as part of <span class="caps">SLAAC</span> caused some vendors,
Microsoft Windows most notably, to pursue client IPv6 autoconfiguration which
required DHCPv6.  This makes the use of DHCPv6 a near requirement in any network
that has liberal requirements for operating system&nbsp;support.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="host-registration-in-dns">
<h3>Host Registration in <span class="caps">DNS</span></h3>
<p>Providing <span class="caps">DNS</span> configuration to an autoconfiguring host does not imply
registering that host in the local <span class="caps">DNS</span> tables.  In fact, neither DHCPv4, nor
DHCPv6 address the issue of <span class="caps">DNS</span> registration of newly configured hosts.  In many
environments, including the lab, and prototype use case environments,
registering configured hosts ranges from very helpful to required.  Some clients
will perform this task, but this behavior is not common enough to rely on&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>There are a number of different tools to support registering hosts in <span class="caps">DNS</span> as
they join a network, but one project is more appealing than the others for our
given use cases:  <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html">Dnsmasq</a>.  The Dnsmasq project combines <span class="caps">DHCP</span> and <span class="caps">DNS</span> in a
single daemon and supports both IPv4 and IPv6.  Dnsmasq also supports portions
of IPv6 autoconfiguration, including router advertisement (<span class="caps">RA</span>).  The feature
that places Dnsmasq in the most appealing position is that its <span class="caps">DHCP</span> and <span class="caps">DNS</span>
integration includes automatically registering <span class="caps">DHCP</span> leases in the <span class="caps">DNS</span> tables
when a hostname is provided in the <span class="caps">DHCP</span> request; solving exactly the problem not
explicitly addressed in <span class="caps">DHCP</span> or <span class="caps">DNS</span>&nbsp;specifications.</p>
<p>Through experimentation it was determined that Windows and Mac <span class="caps">OSX</span> based systems
consistently provide the hostname as part of their <span class="caps">DHCP</span> request.  Unfortunately,
the most popular, and widely used, <span class="caps">DHCP</span> client, from <span class="caps">ISC</span>, either does not, or is
rarely configured to send the hostname.  Fortunately, an alternative <span class="caps">DHCP</span> client
does: the <a class="reference external" href="http://roy.marples.name/projects/dhcpcd/index">dhcpcd</a> client.  Investigating the dhcpcd client also revealed that
it is trivial to swap the <span class="caps">ISC</span> client for dhcpcd on most Linux&nbsp;hosts.</p>
