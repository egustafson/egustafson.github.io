      <description>Last month, after looking at BitTorrent Sync and realizing it was encrypted and private, but not open source, I went digging for an alternative. I found the perfect project, for me: Syncthing. The project is still relatively young and while it has proven to be perfectly functional, it did not come with batteries included &amp;ndash; an installer package. It does come with init scripts for some environments, but not for Ubuntu &amp;ndash; at least until Ubuntu transitions to systemd.</description>
