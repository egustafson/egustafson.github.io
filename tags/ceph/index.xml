      <description>The following is my distillation of how to install Ceph in the most minimal way. This method of installation is NOT the {right, correct, best, &amp;hellip;} way to install Ceph. It is what I could discern as the most minimal way to install the smallest set of Ceph components to have a minimally running system. I did this to better understand Ceph and hope it will help others as well.</description>
