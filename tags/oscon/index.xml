      <description>Note (2017): this draft document was never completed. I am publishing it in its incomplete, draft state because there are a number of good links in the document &amp;ndash; reader beware.
 In this second part of my trip report I have included my notes on each of the sessions I attended. The purpose of this post is two fold. First, as a place to archive my notes and catalog the materials of the presentation.</description>

      <description>This year&amp;rsquo;s OSCON was my first attendance of the conference; I was pleasantly surprised. The conference is 5 days, the first two of which are half day tutorial sessions, and the remaining 3 being the core conference. I attended the 3 core days of the conference, and my brain was completely overflowed by the end.
In this post, part 1 of 2, the interesting items of note in the Keynote presentations are discussed.</description>
