      <description>In my previous article, IPv6 Tunneling over IPv4 Networks, I discussed how to connect a LAN to the IPv6 public Internet. This article continues the theme, discussing the issues surrounding the LAN&amp;rsquo;s configuration for IPv6.
Looking at how LAN&amp;rsquo;s are configured for IPv4 proves to be instructive. Many of the techniques, and all of the patterns turn out to have parallels in IPv6. During the design of IPv6 engineers took the opportunity for refactoring using lessons learned from IPv4.</description>

      <title>Diskless Install of Ubuntu with PXE &amp; Dnsmasq</title>

      <description>The other day I received a &amp;ldquo;server&amp;rdquo; (HP Z620) as part of work. I set out to integrate it into a new subnet to be used like a mini-cloud LAN. Since my &amp;ldquo;lab&amp;rdquo; is a floor down from my office my first goal was to make this &amp;ldquo;server&amp;rdquo; remote everything, right down to the BIOS. This way I could reboot and even reload the bare metal OS remotely. The Z620 has Intel AMT and I&amp;rsquo;ve progressed that to the point where I can remotely power on/off the machine &amp;ndash; more on that in another article.</description>
