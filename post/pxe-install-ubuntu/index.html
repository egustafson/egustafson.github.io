<p>The other day I received a &ldquo;server&rdquo; (HP Z620) as part of work.  I set out to
integrate it into a new subnet to be used like a mini-cloud LAN.  Since my &ldquo;lab&rdquo;
is a floor down from my office my first goal was to make this &ldquo;server&rdquo; remote
everything, right down to the BIOS.  This way I could reboot and even <em>reload</em>
the bare metal OS remotely.  The Z620 has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Active_Management_Technology">Intel
AMT</a> and I&rsquo;ve
progressed that to the point where I can remotely power on/off the machine &ndash;
more on that in another article.  The next step was to setup
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment">PXE</a> booting.</p>

<p>In my past I&rsquo;ve setup PXE environments, but as I started to reason through what
I needed I realized that I had over simplified.  Did I want to PXE install, or
PXE boot a kernel with the root filesystem on local disk?  Both actually, and
maybe some other PXE acrobatics.  Step one: PXE boot into an installation and
then automate the installation with a
<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/14.04/installation-guide/amd64/apb.html">preseed</a> file.</p>

<h1 id="pxe-boot-to-install-ubuntu">PXE Boot to Install - Ubuntu</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/14.04/installation-guide/amd64/index.html">Ubuntu Installation
Guide</a> covers
most of what is described below.  The one exception is that I prefer Dnsmasq_
for its simplicity, and every PXE boot example I found seems to want to explain
the process with the amalgamation of the ISC DHCP server, and one of the many,
execellent tftpd servers.
<a href="http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html">Dnsmasq</a> was made for this, why
is a more complex tool chain being consistently pushed?  &ndash; I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>Additionally, I, like many people, like prototyping in a virtual environment.  I
use <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>, and VirtualBox supports PXE
booting.  In fact, there are a couple of ways to do a PXE boot in VirtualBox.
This example will <strong>not</strong> use any of VirtualBox&rsquo;s built-in PXE boot features.
Instead, two (virtual) hosts will be configured, one as the PXE boot server, and
a second as the booted client.  This pattern mimics physical hardware, and, in
fact, should be reproducable on physical equipment by simply ignoring the
VirtualBox commentary.</p>

<h2 id="prerequesites">Prerequesites</h2>

<ol>
<li>(optional) VirtualBox, host OS doesn&rsquo;t matter.  This article is written with
VirtualBox instructions, ignoring the VirtualBox parts and using physical
hardware should just work.</li>
<li>A linux server.  Package install commands based on Ubuntu, any distribution
should work; infact any OS with Dnsmasq should work the same.</li>
<li>A client host &ndash; the disk on this machine will be <strong>erased</strong>.  The example
will use a newly created VirtualBox host.</li>
<li>A &ldquo;dhcp free&rdquo; LAN.  In this example, a VirtualBox &ldquo;Internal Network&rdquo; will
serve as the LAN.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="pxe-dhcp-and-a-clean-lan">PXE, DHCP, and a &ldquo;clean&rdquo; LAN</h2>

<p>For those familiar with DHCP&rsquo;s broadcast use of the LAN, this section may be
safely skipped.</p>

<p>The first step in a &ldquo;PXE Boot&rdquo; is for the client host to perform a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol">DHCP</a>
request, or more precisely a DHCP discovery.  This amounts to the client sending
a broadcast IP message on the connected LAN.  Because the client knows nothing
of itself at this point, it can only broadcast a message requesting it&rsquo;s
configuration, the &ldquo;C&rdquo; in DHCP.  Many LAN&rsquo;s support DHCP, including the default
VirtualBox &ldquo;NAT&rdquo; LAN.  In order to PXE boot a specific response to the DHCP
request must be given; the culmunation of this article in fact.  If the PXE
booting client is &ldquo;placed&rdquo; on a LAN that already has a DHCP service present then
it is possible that the existing service will respond, and respond with a
generic response, not the PXE specific response this article details crafting.</p>

<p>For this reason, the &ldquo;dhcp free&rdquo; LAN is stated above as a prerequisite.  If you
know you have a DHCP free physical LAN then you&rsquo;re good; many home &ldquo;routers&rdquo;
provide DHCP as part of their functionality &ndash; you&rsquo;ve been warned.</p>

<p>VirtualBox&rsquo;s default network is the &ldquo;NAT&rdquo; network and it has a DHCP service
embedded in the VirtualBox &lsquo;controller&rsquo;.  This LAN network can not be used.
Details for configuring multiple VirtualBox networks will be given below for
this very reason.</p>

<p>Ideas for follow on articles around this topic:</p>

<ul>
<li>PXE Boot a &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; image, (think Amazon AMI/LXC ubuntu-cloud like), on bare
metal &ndash; there are some gotcha&rsquo;s in this.</li>
<li>PXE Boot every time.  A &ldquo;production&rdquo; environment where the bootloader is PXE,
the kernel comes across the network, and the filesystem already exists on one
of {local disk, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage_area_network">SAN</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage">NAS</a>}.</li>
<li><em>PXE Acrobatics</em>: An advanced, intellegent system for PXE booting where
sometimes an existing system is booted, and sometimes the host is
reprovisioned, i.e. re-installed.</li>
